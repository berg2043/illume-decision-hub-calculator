# Illume Decision Hub Calculator
Group Project for Prime Digital Academy 

Client: Illume Pricing

Group: Phillip Berg, Harrison Nguyen, Awren Nuit, and Courtney Olesee


_Duration: 2 week sprint_
***currently in progress***

The application is designed to help small business owners generate more profits. Using conversational language through a “choose your own adventure” format, clients will be prompted to enter their financial information to create predictive calculations based on business decisions they can make around product pricing, operating costs, and total revenue. This will help clients better understand how changes in their decision-making and pricing could affect their future profitability.

## Built With
- React
- Axios, PG, Node, Express
- PostgresSQL

## Challenges
- Git branching with multiple users
    - Solved by having multi-phase testing so that each contributor has branches tested by another user before being able to create pull request. This way we rarely (if ever) had any broken code in master. First, the creator tested their own code and solved any master conflicts. Then, another contributor tested that branch. Then the creator of the code created a new pull request which was checked by another contributor before merging to the master branch. 
- Database construction 

## Stretch Goals
- Admin ability to change order of questions
